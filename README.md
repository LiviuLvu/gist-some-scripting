# Scripts musings
My simple scripts for fun and learning, also used as demo for articles.
For now i'm only writing in bash, exploring the Linux terminal. In the future the plan is to also dabble in some python and other languages.

Recommend links to other fun resources for learning scripting in any language, to be added here.
